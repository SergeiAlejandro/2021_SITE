              Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
                Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers
              can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a
              “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to
              Python, has Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.

              These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.
              For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to
              place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
              <br><br>
              There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We’ve compiled overviews of the 4 languages
              we have learned so far down below.
